* Cronjobs to automatically remove expired items
* Email user when todo item deadline is less than 24 hours away 
* Partials to separate forms from main view files (code is very clunky at the moment)
* Separate javascript code for char countdown on textfields and place in appropriate place
* Ability to amend deadline time
